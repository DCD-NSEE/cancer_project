# Cancer Project

Here is presented the project documentation using all types of cancer provided by FOSP (Fundação Oncocentro de São Paulo).

The project aims to use machine learning models to predict and identify the characteristics that most interfere in the death and survival of cancer patients in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The data were extracted from the Deputy Directorate of Information and Epidemiology of Fundação Oncocentro de São Paulo, coordinator of the Hospital Cancer Registry of São Paulo, and contains patients treated between 2000 and 2021.

The project was developed using the python language, using machine learning models, specifically the models Random Forest and XGBoost. Access the documentation [here](https://cancer-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
